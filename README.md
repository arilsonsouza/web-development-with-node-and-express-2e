# Examples - Web Development with Node and Express, 2nd Edition

*WORK IN PROGRESS*

Most of the code samples in this repo are complete, if difficult to navigate.  I am in the progress up updating the README files to make it easier to find your way around.

## Chapters

### Chapter 1

This is just an introductory chapter, with no example code.

### Chapter 2

The Chapter 2 Examples demonstrate a simple, minimal web server using Node only (no Express) to provide the reader a little background.

### Chapter 3

The Chapter 3 Examples demonstrate a simple, minimal web server using Express.

### Chapter 4

The Chapter 4 Example take the "fortune cookie" functionality deveoped in Chapter 3, and implement it as a Node module.

### Chapter 5

The Chapter 5 Example demonstrates unit testing with Jest, integration testing with Jest and Puppeteer, and linting with ESLint.

### Chapter 6

The Chapter 6 Example uses small examples to demonstrate various useful features of Express, such as rendering views, using cookies and sessions, processing forms, and providing an API.

### Chapter 7

The Chapter 7 covers templating (using Handlebars), which lays the foundation of building useful websites with Express.

### Chapter 8

The Chapter 8, discuss the different methods for handling forms, form validation, and file uploads.

### Chapter 9

The Chapter 9 cover cookies, sessions, rounding out the things you need to know to build basic functional websites with Express.

### Chapter 10
The Chapter 10 delves into middleware, a concept central to Express.

### Chapter 11
The Chapter 11 explains how to use middleware to send email from the server
and discusses security and layout issues inherent to email.

### Chapter 12
The Chapter 12 offers a preview into production concerns. Even though at this
stage in the book you don’t have all the information you need to build a
production-ready website, thinking about production now can save you
from major headaches in the future.

### Chapter 13
The Chapter 13 is about persistence, with a focus on MongoDB (one of the
leading document databases) and PostgreSQL (a popular open-source relational database management system).

### Chapter 14
Chapter 14 gets into the details of routing with Express (how URLs aremapped to content)

### Chapter 15
The Chapter 15 takes a diversion into writing APIs with Express. 

### Chapter 16
The Chapter 16 takes what we’ve learned about Express and uses it to refactor
the running example as an SPA, with Express as the backend server
providing the API we created in Chapter 15.

### Chapter 17
The Chapter 17 covers the details of serving static content, with a focus on maximizing performance.

### Chapter 18
The Chapter 18 discusses security: how to build authentication and
authorization into your app (with a focus on using a third-party
authentication provider), as well as how to run your site over HTTPS.

### Chapter 19
The Chapter 19 explains how to integrate with third-party services. Examples
used are Twitter, Google Maps, and the US National Weather Service.
